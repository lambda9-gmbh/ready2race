# Ready2Race Frontend

## Contributing

### Code format

Make sure to format your code with Prettier. It is already added as a devDependency and ready to use after `npm install`.

### Local Configuration

Add `.env` to the frontend root with adequate keys/values. You can copy `template.env` for fitting keys.

### Noteworthy Packages

Before implementing own solutions, it is recommended to check the already used libraries for fitting features.
