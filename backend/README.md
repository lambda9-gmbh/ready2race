# Ready2Race Backend

## Installation

### Dependencies
- docker compose

### Building
To build the backend `.jar`-File, you have to boot a local postgres database container via docker compose and run the
Maven-Wrapper. Run these commands :
```shell
$ docker compose up -d
$ ./mvnw clean package
```
This should generate a `/target` directory, where you can find the Archive bundled with dependencies to run it.

## Running

### Configure application

Add an adequate `.env` to your server and give its Path as first argument when running the application. You can copy
`template.env` for fitting keys.

### Configure Hashing

Password4j with Argon2 is used for Hashing. By default, a `psw4j.properties` file is used with default values. You can find
recommended settings in the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/Password4j/password4j/wiki/Recommended-settings#argon2).
To set the path to your custom properties file, you can use

`-Dpsw4j.configuration=path/to/my/file.properties`

when starting the application with Java.

### Configure Logging

With `-Dlog4j.configurationFile=/path/to/your/log4j2.xml` you can provide a logging configuration, when starting your application.
There is a default logging configuration at `/src/main/resources/log4j2.xml`.

### Starting API

Run the following command to start up the application (you can use additional options described above):
```shell
$ java -jar ready2race.jar config.env
```

When building the jar yourself, the name of it should look like `ready2race-api-{version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.

## Contributing

### Local Configuration

Add `.env` to the backend root with adequate keys/values. You can copy `template.env` for fitting keys.
You can use any other name f√ºr your local Env-File, you just need to add its name as first Argument when
starting the application. Without the argument, `.env` will be used.

### Ktor Plugins

Before adding new server features, please make sure there isn't already a usable ktor plugin for the job.
